    title: "ClamAV: Ensure real-time scanning is enabled"
    description: "The ClamAV daemon should be configured for real-time scanning."
    rationale: "Real-time scanning helps detect malware as soon as it appears on the system."
    remediation: "Enable the ScanOnAccess option in clamd configuration."
    compliance:
      - pci_dss: ["5.1", "5.2"]
      - nist_800_53: ["SI-3"]
    condition: all

  - id: 28110
    title: "ClamAV: Ensure automatic database updates are enabled"
    description: "The freshclam daemon should be configured to automatically update virus databases."
    rationale: "Regular updates to virus definitions are crucial for effective malware detection."
    remediation: "Enable automatic updates in freshclam.conf and ensure Checks value is at least 24."
    compliance:
      - pci_dss: ["5.2"]
      - nist_800_53: ["SI-3(2)"]
    condition: all

  - id: 28120
    title: "ClamAV: Verify maximum file size scanning limits"
    description: "Check if maximum file size limits are set appropriately."
    rationale: "Setting appropriate file size limits prevents resource exhaustion while ensuring large files are still scanned."
    remediation: "Set MaxFileSize and MaxScanSize to appropriate values (recommended: at least 100M)."
    compliance:
      - pci_dss: ["5.1"]
      - nist_800_53: ["SI-3"]

    title: "ClamAV: Check for appropriate permissions on configuration files"
    description: "Configuration files should have secure permissions."
    rationale: "Proper file permissions prevent unauthorized modifications to ClamAV configuration."
    remediation: "Set permissions to 644 and ownership to root:root for configuration files."
    compliance:
      - pci_dss: ["7.1"]
      - nist_800_53: ["AC-3", "AC-6"]

    title: "ClamAV: Ensure log rotation is configured"
    description: "Log files should be rotated to manage disk space."
    rationale: "Log rotation prevents disk space exhaustion and maintains logging history."
    remediation: "Configure LogRotate option in both clamd and freshclam configurations."
    compliance:
      - pci_dss: ["10.7"]
      - nist_800_53: ["AU-4"]
    condition: all
